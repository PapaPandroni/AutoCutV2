# AutoCut - Claude Code Development Prompt

## 🎯 Project Overview

### What is AutoCut?
AutoCut is a desktop application that automatically creates beat-synced highlight videos from raw footage and music. It analyzes video quality, detects the music's rhythm, and intelligently assembles clips that match the beat - all without requiring any video editing knowledge.

### Who is it for?
- **Primary Users**: Families, travelers, and hobbyists with lots of unedited video footage
- **Use Cases**: Family vacations, birthday parties, weddings, sports events, travel compilations
- **User Profile**: Non-technical users who want professional-looking results with minimal effort

### Core Value Proposition
Transform hours of raw footage into a polished, music-synced highlight reel in minutes, not hours.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE

1. **ALWAYS test each implementation step before proceeding**
2. **STOP after each major step for manual testing and git commit**
3. **Create small, atomic commits with clear messages**
4. **If something doesn't work, debug it completely before moving forward**
5. **Keep the implementation SIMPLE - avoid over-engineering**
6. **Test with real video files after each step**

## 🎯 Core Algorithm Detail

### Beat-to-Clip Matching Logic
```python
def calculate_clip_constraints(bpm):
    """
    For a given BPM, calculate allowed clip durations
    
    Examples:
    - 60 BPM = 1 beat/second → clips: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
    - 120 BPM = 2 beats/second → clips: 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s
    - 90 BPM = 1.5 beats/second → clips: 0.67s, 1.33s, 2.67s, 5.33s
    """
    beat_duration = 60.0 / bpm
    
    # Minimum clip is 1 beat (but at least 0.5 seconds)
    min_duration = max(beat_duration, 0.5)
    
    # Allowed durations are musical multiples
    multipliers = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
    allowed_durations = [beat_duration * m for m in multipliers]
    
    # Filter out clips longer than 8 seconds
    allowed_durations = [d for d in allowed_durations if d <= 8.0]
    
    return min_duration, allowed_durations
```

### Variety Pattern System
```python
# Prevent monotony by varying clip lengths
VARIETY_PATTERNS = {
    'energetic': [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4],  # Mostly fast with occasional pause
    'buildup': [4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1],    # Start slow, increase pace
    'balanced': [2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1],   # Mixed pacing
    'dramatic': [1, 1, 1, 1, 8],      # Fast cuts then long hold
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Stuttering/Freezing
- **Cause**: Imprecise cut points, codec issues
- **Solution**: Use MoviePy's `subclip()` method, always cut on keyframes

### Choppy Audio
- **Cause**: Trying to manipulate audio track
- **Solution**: NEVER modify audio, only sync video cuts to it

### Memory Issues
- **Cause**: Loading entire videos into memory
- **Solution**: Process videos in chunks, use generators

### Slow Processing
- **Cause**: Inefficient scene detection
- **Solution**: Skip frames (analyze every 10th frame), use threading

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Before considering any step complete:

□ **Unit Test**: Individual functions work correctly
□ **Integration Test**: Modules work together
□ **Real Media Test**: Use actual family videos
□ **Edge Cases**: Empty videos, silent music, single scene videos
□ **Performance**: Can handle 1 hour of footage
□ **Quality Check**: Output looks professional

## 💡 Remember

- **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **Test Early, Test Often**: Don't write 100 lines without testing
- **User First**: Every decision should make it easier for non-technical users
- **Iterate**: Version 1 doesn't need to be perfect

**Most importantly**: After each step, STOP and wait for confirmation before proceeding. Each step should result in working, tested code that can be committed to git.
