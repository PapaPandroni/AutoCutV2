```

### ðŸš§ Step 3: Advanced Video Scoring - IN PROGRESS
**Status**: 30% Complete (Structure ready, functions need implementation)
**Next Priority**: Implement motion detection and face detection
```
ðŸš§ Add motion detection:
  - Optical flow between frames using OpenCV
  - Calculate motion intensity scores
  - Higher motion = more interesting content
  - Integration with existing quality scoring

ðŸš§ Add face detection (optional):
  - Use OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier
  - Count faces in sampled frames
  - More faces = higher score for family videos
  - Handle multiple face detection across scenes

ðŸš§ Implement analyze_video_file() main function:
  - Combine all scoring methods (sharpness, brightness, contrast, motion, faces)
  - Return list of scored VideoChunk objects
  - Integrate with scene detection
  - Sort results by combined quality score

ðŸš§ Test with family videos:
  - Verify face detection accuracy
  - Check motion detection responds to camera movement/action
  - Ensure dark/blurry/shaky footage gets appropriately low scores
  - Validate combined scoring produces good ranking
```

### ðŸ”œ Step 4: Clip Assembly Logic - PLANNED
**Status**: 10% Complete (Structure defined, needs implementation)
```
â–¡ Implement basic assembly:
  - Match video chunks to beat grid using timestamps
  - Respect minimum/maximum clip durations from audio analysis
  - Fill entire song duration with selected clips
  - Handle gaps and overlaps in timeline

â–¡ Add variety patterns:
  - Apply predefined rhythm patterns (energetic, buildup, balanced, dramatic)
  - Prevent repetitive cutting (max 3 consecutive same-duration clips)
  - Mix short and long clips based on musical structure
  - Balance excitement vs. breathing room

â–¡ Implement select_best_clips() function:
  - Sort clips by combined quality score
  - Ensure variety in source videos (don't overuse single video)
  - Avoid using same scene/timestamp twice
  - Balance quality vs. variety with configurable weight

â–¡ Create timeline data structure:
  - List of (video_file, start, end, beat_position, score) tuples
  - Export as JSON for debugging and manual review
  - Validate timeline completeness and timing
  - Handle edge cases (insufficient good clips, timing conflicts)
```

### ðŸ”œ Step 5: Video Rendering - PLANNED
**Status**: 5% Complete (Structure outlined)
```
â–¡ Implement render_video() function:
  - Use MoviePy CompositeVideoClip for assembly
  - Add music track without any audio manipulation (critical!)
  - Maintain source video quality and frame rates
  - Progress callback integration for GUI updates

â–¡ Add transitions:
  - Simple crossfade between clips (0.5s default)
  - Fade in/out at start/end of final video
  - Ensure transitions don't interfere with beat timing
  - Handle different source resolutions gracefully

â–¡ Optimize rendering:
  - Use appropriate codec (H.264 for compatibility)
  - Maintain source quality while managing file size
  - Memory-efficient processing for long videos
  - Error recovery for rendering failures

â–¡ Test complete pipeline:
  - End-to-end test: multiple videos + music â†’ final output
  - Check for stuttering, sync issues, quality degradation
  - Verify music stays perfectly in sync throughout
  - Test with various input combinations (different formats/qualities)
```

### ðŸ”œ Step 6: Simple GUI - PLANNED  
**Status**: 0% Complete
```
â–¡ Create basic Tkinter window:
  - File selection widgets for videos (multiple selection)
  - File selection widget for music (single file)
  - Output location selection with default naming
  - Generate button with progress indication
  - Status messages and error display

â–¡ Add settings panel:
  - Tempo preference slider (Fast/Normal/Slow multiplier)
  - Target duration input (or "match music length")
  - Face priority checkbox (weight face detection higher)
  - Variety pattern dropdown (energetic/buildup/balanced/dramatic)

â–¡ Implement threading:
  - Background processing to keep GUI responsive
  - Progress bar updates during analysis and rendering
  - Cancel operation capability
  - Proper error handling and user notification

â–¡ Add preview capability:
  - Show first 10-15 seconds of generated video
  - Play with synchronized audio
  - Quick preview generation (lower quality/resolution)
  - Allow regeneration with different settings
```

### ðŸ”œ Step 7: Polish and Packaging - PLANNED
**Status**: 0% Complete  
```
â–¡ Add comprehensive error handling:
  - Unsupported file formats with helpful messages
  - Corrupted/incomplete video files
  - "No good clips found" scenario with suggestions
  - Recovery options for partial failures

â–¡ Create user presets:
  - "Action" preset: Fast cuts, motion-prioritized
  - "Cinematic" preset: Slower cuts, dramatic variety pattern
  - "Musical" preset: Perfect beat alignment, rhythm-focused
  - "Family" preset: Face detection priority, balanced pacing

â–¡ Write user documentation:
  - README with clear examples and screenshots
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Performance tips for large video collections
  - Technical documentation for developers

â–¡ Package application:
  - PyInstaller configuration for standalone executable
  - Test on fresh systems (Windows, Mac, Linux)
  - Create installer packages with dependencies
  - Automated build process and releases
