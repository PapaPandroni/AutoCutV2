# AutoCut V2 Project Overview

## Project Purpose
AutoCut is a desktop application that automatically creates beat-synced highlight videos from raw footage and music. It analyzes video quality, detects music rhythm, and intelligently assembles clips that match the beat - all without requiring video editing knowledge.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Families, travelers, hobbyists with unedited video footage
- **Use Cases**: Family vacations, birthday parties, weddings, sports events, travel compilations
- **Profile**: Non-technical users wanting professional results with minimal effort

## Core Value Proposition
Transform hours of raw footage into polished, music-synced highlight reel in minutes, not hours.

## Development Status (UPDATED)
- **Current Phase**: Advanced Video Scoring (Step 3 of 7)
- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Language**: Python 3.12.3
- **Virtual Environment**: Located at `env/` (activate with `source env/bin/activate`)

### âœ… COMPLETED STEPS (Fully Tested)
**Step 1: Audio Analysis Module**
- BPM detection using librosa with harmonic-percussive separation
- Beat timestamp extraction with proper validation
- Musical clip duration calculation based on tempo
- Edge case handling for slow/fast songs
- **TESTED**: 3 real music files (99-123 BPM, 74-193 seconds)

**Step 2: Basic Video Analysis**
- Video loading with MoviePy (import compatibility fixed)
- Scene detection via frame difference analysis (1.0s sampling for performance)
- Quality scoring: sharpness (40%), brightness (30%), contrast (30%)
- Multi-format support (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM)
- **TESTED**: 16 diverse videos (720p-4K, 24-30fps, 9-35 seconds)
- **PERFORMANCE**: ~8 videos/minute, quality scores 38-79/100

### ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
**Step 3: Advanced Video Scoring** (Next Priority)
- Motion detection using optical flow
- Face detection for family videos (OpenCV cascade)
- Enhanced quality metrics combination

## Key Features (Status)
1. **âœ… Audio Analysis**: BPM detection, beat timestamps - COMPLETE
2. **âœ… Basic Video Analysis**: Scene detection, quality scoring - COMPLETE
3. **ðŸš§ Advanced Video Scoring**: Motion, face detection - IN PROGRESS
4. **ðŸ”œ Beat-to-Clip Matching**: Intelligent synchronization with musical timing
5. **ðŸ”œ Variety Patterns**: Prevent monotonous cutting with rhythm patterns
6. **ðŸ”œ Simple GUI**: Tkinter-based interface for non-technical users
7. **ðŸ”œ Professional Output**: Frame-accurate cuts, smooth transitions

## Real-World Testing Results
- **Audio Files**: 3 songs successfully analyzed (precise BPM detection)
- **Video Files**: 16 videos processed in ~2 minutes total
- **Formats**: Multi-resolution (720p to 4K), multi-framerate (24-30fps)
- **Scene Detection**: 1-14 scenes per video, adaptive threshold working
- **Quality Scoring**: Good distribution 38-79/100, identifies best content

## Success Metrics
- Processing Speed: âœ… 10 minutes footage â†’ <2 minutes processing (achieved)
- Sync Accuracy: ðŸš§ >95% cuts align with beats (in progress)
- Visual Quality: ðŸš§ No stuttering, smooth transitions (in progress)
- Variety: ðŸ”œ Max 3 consecutive same-duration cuts (planned)
- Usability: ðŸ”œ Non-technical users succeed without help (planned)
