# AutoCut V2 Memory Optimization & Performance Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary
Transform AutoCut V2 from 83% memory usage to <40% while achieving 5-10x performance improvement through strategic FFmpeg integration and Apple Silicon hardware acceleration, maintaining the production-ready quality we've achieved.

## Core Problem Analysis ✅

**Current Memory Bottlenecks Identified:**
- **MoviePy Memory Pressure**: Loads entire video clips into RAM simultaneously 
- **Concurrent Clip Loading**: 68+ clips × 50-200MB each = 3-13GB memory usage
- **No Hardware Acceleration**: Software-only processing on M2 MacBook Pro  
- **Synchronous Processing**: Sequential operations blocking efficient resource usage

**Target Performance Goals:**
- Memory usage: 83% → <40% (60% reduction)
- Processing speed: 2-3 minutes → 20-30 seconds (5-10x faster)
- Quality: Maintain current high-quality output standards
- Compatibility: Preserve all current format support

## Strategic Architecture Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)

1. **Create FFmpeg Streaming Module** (`src/video/rendering/ffmpeg/`)
   - Replace `VideoFileClip` batch loading with streaming frame processing
   - Implement `StreamingVideoAnalyzer` using DeFFcode/PyAV
   - Target: 60% memory reduction immediately

2. **Hardware Detection & Acceleration Setup**

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### FFmpeg Integration Pattern
**Hybrid Architecture (Risk Mitigation)**
```python
class VideoProcessor:
    def __init__(self, use_ffmpeg=True):
        self.ffmpeg_processor = FFmpegProcessor() if use_ffmpeg else None
        self.moviepy_processor = MoviePyProcessor()  # Fallback
        
    def process_video(self, video_path):
        try:
            if self.ffmpeg_processor:
                return self.ffmpeg_processor.process(video_path)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"FFmpeg failed: {e}, falling back to MoviePy")
            return self.moviepy_processor.process(video_path)
```

### Memory-Efficient Streaming
**Analysis Without Loading**
```python
def analyze_video_streaming(video_path):
    # Stream frames without loading entire video
    decoder = FFdecoder(video_path, 
                       frame_format="bgr24",
                       **m2_hardware_params).formulate()
    
    analysis_results = []
    for frame in decoder.generateFrame():
        if frame is None: break
        
        # Immediate analysis, no accumulation
        quality = calculate_quality(frame)
        motion = detect_motion(frame) 
        analysis_results.append({'quality': quality, 'motion': motion})
        # Frame automatically freed
    
    decoder.terminate()
    return analysis_results  # ~50KB vs 500MB+ for full video
```

### Apple Silicon Hardware Acceleration  
**M2-Optimized Configuration**
```python
m2_hardware_params = {
    # Decoding
    "-hwaccel": "videotoolbox",
    "-hwaccel_output_format": "videotoolbox_vld",
    
    # Encoding (HEVC preferred on M2)
    "-c:v": "hevc_videotoolbox",
    "-q:v": "65",  # Quality balance
    "-realtime": "1"
}
```
