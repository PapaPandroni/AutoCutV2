  I have read all the code in the repository, including the bug report you provided. Based on my analysis, I have identified the root causes of the "Killed"
  error and have formulated a plan to fix it.

  Analysis of the Problem


  The "Killed" message indicates that the operating system is terminating the process due to excessive memory consumption. My analysis points to two main
  culprits:


   1. A Race Condition in `VideoCache`: The PyMemoryView_FromBuffer(): info->buf must not be NULL and read of closed file warnings strongly suggest that multiple
      threads are interfering with each other when accessing video files. The current implementation of VideoCache in src/clip_assembler.py uses a reference
      counting system that is prone to race conditions, causing files to be closed prematurely while they are still being used.


   2. High Memory Usage During Rendering: The render_video function in src/clip_assembler.py loads all 53 video clips into memory, normalizes them, and then
      concatenates them. This process is extremely memory-intensive, especially the compose concatenation method, which is used when clips have different
      resolutions or frame rates. This is the primary reason for the memory exhaustion that leads to the "Killed" message.


  Plan for Improvement


  My plan is to refactor the video rendering pipeline to be more memory-efficient and to eliminate the race condition. Here are the steps I will take:


   1. Simplify `VideoCache` to Prevent Race Conditions: I will modify the VideoCache class in src/clip_assembler.py to remove the complex and error-prone reference
      counting system. Instead, the cache will keep all video files open until the rendering process is complete and then clean them up at the end. This will
      prevent files from being closed prematurely and fix the race condition.


   2. Offload Video Normalization to FFmpeg: Instead of normalizing video clips in memory with MoviePy, I will leverage FFmpeg's powerful video filters to perform
      the normalization during the final rendering step. This will dramatically reduce memory usage, as clips will be processed one by one, not all at once.


   3. Enforce Memory-Efficient Concatenation: By offloading the normalization to FFmpeg, I can exclusively use the more memory-efficient "chain" method for video
      concatenation, further reducing the memory footprint.


   4. Refactor the `render_video` Function: I will update the render_video function in src/clip_assembler.py to implement the changes above. This will involve
      removing the in-memory normalization step and constructing the correct FFmpeg parameters to handle normalization during the final render.

  Expected Outcome

  This plan will directly address the root causes of the "Killed" error. The expected outcomes are:


   * Elimination of the "Killed" error: The process will no longer be terminated by the OS for excessive memory usage.
   * Improved Stability: The race condition will be fixed, eliminating the PyMemoryView_FromBuffer and read of closed file errors.
   * Reduced Memory Footprint: The application will use significantly less memory, making it more reliable and able to handle larger video projects.


  I am confident that this plan will resolve the issues you are facing. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with the implementation.
