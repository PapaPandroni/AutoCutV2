  The bug report shows two scenarios: one that finishes with errors and dropped clips, and one that hangs and is manually aborted. Both scenarios point to the
  same root cause.


  Key Symptoms:
   * Warning: Failed to load clip ... PyMemoryView_FromBuffer(): info->buf must not be NULL
   * Warning: Failed to load clip ... read of closed file
   * UserWarning: ... bytes wanted but 0 bytes read at frame index ...
   * The application hangs or crashes during the Step 4: Video Rendering, specifically when trying to load the video clips for final assembly.

  Root Cause:
  These errors are classic symptoms of a race condition and improper resource management when using the moviepy library in a multi-processed environment. Here's
  what is happening:


   1. The application creates multiple VideoFileClip objects in the main process. Each of these objects manages a dedicated ffmpeg subprocess to read video data.
   2. When rendering the final video, moviepy spawns multiple worker processes (Optimal workers: 10 is shown in the log) to speed up rendering.
   3. The VideoFileClip objects (or their file handles and subprocesses) are shared with these worker processes.
   4. This is not a process-safe operation. Multiple processes are trying to control or read from the same underlying ffmpeg subprocess simultaneously. One process
      closes a file or subprocess that another one is still using, leading to the read of closed file and PyMemoryView_FromBuffer (reading from a dead process)
      errors.


  This issue is particularly prevalent on powerful multi-core machines like the Apple M2, where the operating system aggressively schedules the many worker
  processes.

  Plan for Resolution


  My plan is to refactor the video rendering pipeline to ensure that VideoFileClip objects are not shared across processes. This is the standard, robust way to
  use moviepy in parallel. The changes will be primarily focused within src/clip_assembler.py.


  Step 1: Isolate Clip Information
  Instead of creating a list of VideoFileClip objects upfront in the main process, I will first create a simple, serializable list of "clip instructions". Each
  instruction will be a lightweight data object containing the necessary information, such as (source_video_path, start_time, end_time).


  Step 2: Implement "Just-in-Time" Clip Loading
  I will modify the rendering logic so that each worker process receives one of these "clip instructions". The worker will then be responsible for creating the
  VideoFileClip object for its assigned segment, rendering it, and then properly closing it. This ensures that each VideoFileClip and its associated ffmpeg
  subprocess live and die entirely within a single worker, preventing any conflicts.


  Step 3: Refactor `clip_assembler.py`
  I will modify the functions in clip_assembler.py that are responsible for preparing and rendering the timeline. The core change will be to replace the direct
  use of concatenate_videoclips on a list of pre-loaded clips with a custom function or a generator-based approach that implements the "Just-in-Time" loading
  described in Step 2.


  This plan directly targets the identified root cause and will make the video rendering process stable and reliable on multi-core systems. I will now proceed
  with implementing these changes.Okay, I will now begin implementing the fix.


  First, I need to get a fresh look at the current state of the clip_assembler.py file to precisely target my changes.

✦ Okay, I will start by refactoring the code to eliminate the unsafe VideoCache and implement a process-safe method for loading video segments. This is the core
  of the fix.
